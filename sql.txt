n this SQL tutorial, you’ll learn all the basic to advanced SQL concepts like SQL queries, SQL join, SQL injection, SQL insert, and creating tables in SQL. SQL is easy to learn, there are no prerequisites to learning SQL.
So, SQL is a standard database language used to access and manipulate data in databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It was developed by IBM Computer Scientists in the 1970s. By executing queries SQL can create, update, delete, and retrieve data in databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Overall, SQL is a query language that communicates with databases.

What is a Database?
Before deep diving into this free SQL tutorial, let’s understand what a database is.
So, data is the new fuel of this world, but data is unorganized information, so to organize that data, we make a database. A database is an organized collection of structured data, usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Databases help us easily store, access, and manipulate data held on a computer.

Why to Learn SQL?
SQL helps you to easily get information from data with high efficiency. To manipulate the data in databases like Create, Read, Edit, and Delete, we use SQL queries. Users can interact with data stored in relational database management systems. Anyone who knows the English language can easily write SQL queries. Some of the key features of SQL are given below:

Without a lot of coding knowledge, we can manage a database with SQL.
SQL works with database systems from Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, etc.
Simple and easy to learn.
SQL is an ANSI and ISO standard language for database manipulation.
SQL retrieves large amounts of data very fast.

Pre-Requisites to Learn SQL
If you want to learn SQL then, this free SQL tutorial is quite easy to understand because, during the development of this course, we tried our best to provide the best resource to clear your SQL concept.
But we assume that you are already aware of the basic conceptions of computer science, like databases and its types.
So, if you have basic knowledge of RDBMS, then this SQL tutorial provides you with enough knowledge to master SQL.

SQL Basics
SQL or Structure Query Language is a fundamental skill for anyone who wants to interact with databases. This standard Query Language all users to create, manage, and retrieve data from relational databases. In this SQL tutorial PDF, we have listed all the basics of SQL.

Tables in SQL
The cornerstone of any SQL database is the table. Basically, these structure functions is very similar to spreadsheets, which store data in very organized grid format. In this section, you will learn how to Create, Drop, Delete, and more related to Table.

QL Operators
SQL Operators” refers to the fundamental symbols and keywords within the SQL that enable users to perform various operations and SQL AND, OR, LIKE, NOT, and more operators on databases. Here, we have discussed all the SQL operators in a detailed manner with examples.

SQL Data Constraints
Constraints act as rules or conditions imposed on the data, dictating what values are permissible and what actions can be taken. They play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and coherence of the database by preventing errors. So, explore this section to get a hand on SQL Data Constraints.

SQL NOT NULL Constraints
